# Sheeit Parser
A generic parser for Excel formulas.



This crate provides functionality to parse Excel expressions and formulas.
The goal of this crate is to provide an accurate AST representation for Excel formulas.

Unlike other Sheeit-related crates, this can be used very much independently for any project
that requires parsing of Excel functions and formulas. However, the API currently is rather crude
and not very intuitive and user-friendly.
